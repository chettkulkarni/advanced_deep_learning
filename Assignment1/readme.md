Assignmnet_1_Part1:
MIL

Demonstrated MIL using Mnsit Dataset:
Peocess:
1)Train Mnsit data on resnet
2)Create bag of images and new label set
3)Create Aggregation functions
4)using pretrained model and feature set, try to leearn using bag of images
5)Test

Assignment_1_Part2:
Semisupervised learning

Demonstarted Supervised Learning
Dataset: German Loan dataset
process:
1)Split data , and create some portion to be unlabelled
2)Run LR on labelled dataset
3)Using label spreading try to learn with semi supervised learnig . Used KNN and GF
4)Using label propogation try to learn with semi supervised learnig . Used KNN and GF
